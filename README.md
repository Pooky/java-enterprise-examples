Simple Servlet technology example
========================================
Servlet (really terrible name like) is basically the most simple interface in communication with WEB interface.
When computer make request to WebServer, there is some software/service/container which catch this request and server response.
This request could be file, image, folder or something else. The container need to somehow process this and server response back to client.

If we wan't to generate content dynamicly on server, we have to use some language which will do it. We have several options:

| Server 		| Language
| ------------ 	| --------------------------------
| Apache		| PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Rails
| MS Server		| Asp.net
| Tomcat 7 		| Java (Servlet, JSP)

In this case, Tomcat 7 is not really WebServer (or HTTP server) but Servlet and JSP Container which is fully complaint with Java Servlet specification.
There is many versions, which have differend features, each version of Tomcat supports differend one.
