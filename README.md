Java Examples for begginers
=====================
Main aim of this repository is to keep simple java examples, for differend technologies or concepts. Java is today litteraly over-complex and to keep some sanity, it's better to write it down and put some examples around. I try to do it in Wiki and I will also provide here examples, with working technologies. 

Availible examples:

 * Context Dependency Injection - CDI_EXAMPLE
 * Encryption Examples - RSA, Diffie Hellman Key Exchange
 * Jasper Report Example
 * Quartz Scheduler Example
 * RestEasy Example
 * Servlet Example
 * Shiro Security Example
 * Vaadin Exmaple - GUI framework for java

Each folder contain README.md where are instruction how to compile and run specific example.
For building project you need to use Maven.
